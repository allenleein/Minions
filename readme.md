# Minions

A LaunchBar/Alfred replacement for linux, written in rust.

** Work in progress **

## Preview

## Why

- I want to learn rust by writing some projects
- I miss LaunchBar/Alfred in OS X
- I do not want to use [cerebro](https://cerebroapp.com/) (it's un-unix-y and [it uses javascript](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/) and [it uses electron](https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/))

## Goals

- Seperated backend and frontend
    - Currently working on rofi based frontend
    - GTK based frontend is planned
- Extensive (use plugins to add actions)
- Simple, elegant, and most important - do it right in the Unix way
